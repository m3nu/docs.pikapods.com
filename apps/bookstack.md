# Setup

## Sending emails
Bookstack doesn't always require emails, but uses it for select features, like forgotten passwords. To enable sending email, add your SMTP details to `/config/www/.env` using SFTP. This path already contains a pre-populated settings file. Available options can be found [here](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/email-webhooks/).
