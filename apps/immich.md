## Bulk Upload/Import Pictures
Bulk uploading is currently only supported via a CLI tool documented [here](https://immich.app/docs/features/bulk-upload). There is no way yet to upload images via SFTP and import/sync them into Immich.

Also watch the related [Github issue](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/issues/7#issuecomment-1163149634) and [discussion](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/1006) for more background and progress on this feature.
