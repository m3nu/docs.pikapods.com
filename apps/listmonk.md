## Customize System Templates
System templates for emails and public pages are available for editing via [SFTP](/faq/#accessing-pod-files-using-sftp), as described [here](https://listmonk.app/docs/templating/#system-templates). You find them in the `static` folder. It may be necessary to restart the pod to apply changes.
