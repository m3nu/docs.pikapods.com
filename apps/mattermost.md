## Sending emails
Mattermost doesn't always require emails, but uses it for select features, like forgotten passwords. To enable sending email, add your SMTP details as described [here](https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/smtp-email.html). You can use your existing email service or a service recommended in our [email section](/faq/#sending-emails).
