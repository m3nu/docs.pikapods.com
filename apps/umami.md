## No Analytics after Update
After your pod was updated to version v1.39.4 on Nov 2, 2022, you may see a blank analytics page. This is due to authentication changes and can be resolved easily by logging out and back in again, as mentioned [here](https://github.com/umami-software/umami/issues/1598).
